## Tap Deprecation Notice
This custom version of Tmux is no longer needed. Its primary function was to implement support for format specifiers nested inside of command format specifiers. This functionality is supported by Tmux 2.0+ when using long format specifiers.

# Tmux 1.9a1 Homebrew Tap

This tap has been created to specifically install Tmux 1.9a1, which is a patched version of Tmux 1.9a (stable). The modifications add support for parsing of nested format specifiers within command format specifiers. This let's you do things like include the following in a status bar segment:

```sh
#(runMyScriptForSession #session_name)
```

Parsing the `#session_name` format specifier within a command format specifier is not possible with an unpatched Tmux server. More info from the patch [CHANGES](https://github.com/markeissler/tmux/blob/me/statusline-shellcmd-var-substitution/CHANGES) file:

>
>* Add support for parsing of nested format specifiers within command format
>specifiers: `#(do_something.sh #{session_name})`. Both the single format
>specifiers (`#A -> #Z`) and long name specifiers (`#{foo}`) are supported. The
>attribute (#[attributes]) and nested commands (additional `#(foo)` instances)
>are not supported.

The git feature branch for this patch is available for review:

[Tmux 1.9a1 (on Github)](https://github.com/markeissler/tmux/tree/me/statusline-shellcmd-var-substitution)

## Installation

Run the following in your command-line:

```sh
>brew tap markeissler/tmux-19a1
```

## Usage

To list available configuration options run:

```sh
>brew options tmux-19a1
>brew info tmux-19a1
```

Once the tap is installed, you can proceed with `tmux-1.9a1` by running the following from your command-line:

```sh
>brew install tmux-19a1
```

## Why is this a tap vs a submitted improvement to tmux?

The goal is to submit a patch to the official tmux project. If the patch is accepted, then the added functionality will become available in the official binary distribution and installable via the normal _Homebrew/homebrew_ repo. However, there is no guarantee that this additional functionality aligns with the overall goals of the upstream `tmux` project:

[tmux - sourceforge.net, official website](http://tmux.sf.net/)

[tmux - Github clone of official project](https://github.com/ThomasAdam/tmux)

In the meantime, the tap is here for those that need it, want it.

## What about conflicts?

This version of `tmux` can be installed alongside the current stable install from _Homebrew/homebrew_, but there is one caveat: both versions cannot be linked at the same time! To switch between versions use `brew unlink` and `brew link` as follows:

```sh
>brew unlink tmux
>brew link tmux-19a1
```
